# ananse-map
We are creating an open map/database for all the innovation spaces everywhere! This Atlas will merge lists of community innovation spaces from disparate existing maps onto a single, open-source platform— with an API so all data hosted on our platform can be easily shared across other platforms. A tagging system will enable all spaces to share goals and find collaborators across interests such as electronic waste, prosthetics, 3D printing, primary education, green materials, water purification, etc. We have three primary criteria for including a given “community innovation space” on our map:
–  A physical space that promotes creativity and nurtures new ideas
– A community of people eager to collaborate with others: the space must be either open to the public or available for outside partnerships
– A space that utilizes old and/or new technology, including hardware, software, metal-working, handicrafts, repurposed trash, farming, etc.

From mid-June through August, our team will develop, test, and then implement the platform to collaboratively host all these spaces.
